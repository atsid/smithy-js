/**
 * Component lifecycle methods related to services. Any component that wants to use abstracted ajax
 * should include the Services lifecycle, so that a standard lifecycle can be applied.
 * This has additional benefits to development, including (a) the establishment of registry for runtime
 * introspection of functionality, and (b) helper methods available to the component for boilerplate reduction.
 *
 * Any component utilizing Service should use the following practices:
 * 1) Override the setupServices method, and include all store/ajax-related setup in this method only.
 * 2) Use the registerService helper method to do all service setup within setupServices.
 * This will ensure that the lifecycle is properly applied, and that elements such as the registry stay up-to-date.
