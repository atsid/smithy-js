 * Component lifecycle methods related to view rendering. Any component that displays a view

 * introspection of functionality, and (b) helper methods available to the component for boilerplate reduction.
 *
 * Any component utilizing View should use the following practices:
 * 1) Override the setupView method, and include all rendering/widget creation in this method only.
 * This will ensure that the lifecycle is properly applied, and that elements such as the registry stay up-to-date.
