All examples (except PageRoutingExample) are meant to be run directly out of this directory once the following dependencies have been placed in the following locations:

- The contents of "src/main" from schematic-js (https://github.com/atsid/schematic-js.git) should be copied to ./lib/schematic
- The contents of "src/main" from bullhorn-js (https://github.com/atsid/bullhorn-js.git) should be copied to ./lib/bullhorn
- The contents of "src/main" from circuits-js (https://github.com/atsid/circuits-js.git) should be copied to ./lib/circuits
- The dojo, dojox, and dijit directories from a 1.8 dojo distribution (http://dojotoolkit.org/download/) should be copied to ./lib/dojo-1.8.0

The browser should support or be configured to support (i.e. --allow-file-access-from-files for chrome) loading from the file system.

PageRoutingExample uses url extensions to load different layouts for extended urls but the loaded page remains the same.
This necessitates remapping these extended urls to the same html page which is difficult with the file protocol. One way of running the example
is to use an Apache 2.2. server, that has the smithy-js/src symbolically linked to <apache>/htdocs/smithy-project and has the following added
to its httpd.conf:
